    // Takes Data called from the RandomUser API and pushes it to an Array of Objects to be displayed.
    // This process of creating instances and DOM nodes corresponding to React components, and inserting them into the DOM, is called mounting.
    // Note that normally you'd only call ReactDOM.render() to mount the root component(s). You don't need to manually "mount" the child components. Every time a parent component calls setState(), and its render method says a particular child should be rendered for the first time, React will automatically "mount" this child into its parent.
